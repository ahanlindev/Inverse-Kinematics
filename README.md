# README

This is a small inverse kinematics package for Unity3D primarily based upon the Forward-and-Backward-Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm. At this time is has support for pole targets and joint-level angular constraints on top of basic functionality.

For instructions on usage, see the [documentation](/Documentation~/DOCUMENTATION.md).
